**DISCLAIMER: This is an altered version of the original project: https://github.com/red42/HTML5_Genetic_Cars**

This fork exists as an experimental playground for testing agentic AI coding capabilities and exploring the limitations of AI-assisted development.

This is inspired by BoxCar2D, and uses the same physics engine, Box2D, but it's written from scratch.

The current module-based format required npm and browserify.

Build with:

npm run-script build
